# Cancer_Prediction_CNN
To predict the type of cancer

The aim for this project was to accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.

The dataset consisted of 257 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the ISIC. The data set has images of total 9 diseases.

A custom CNN model was architected to predict the cancer. Later in order to boost the accuracy of the model, data augmentor was used to increase training data size.
